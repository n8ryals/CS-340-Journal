1. Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs

Through this project, I learned to write code in a modular way so that it would be easy to maintain.
The CRUD Python Module separated all database functionality from the code that handled visualization.
This left the dashboard code cleaner and easier to debug when I ran into issues.
In the future, I can repurpose this in a project that requires simple database operations.

2. Problem Solving as a Computer Scientist

I approached the project by establishing what data the client needed and writing up queries that would provide it.
I worked incrementally. I built in small portions, checked them, and then integrating them into the dashboard.
In earlier courses, the programs were static, but this one involved a number of systems, 
like active databases, web dashboards, and dynamic queries.
For future projects, I'll start with clear data models and use mock data to prototype my projects quickly.

3. What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters
Computer scientists morph data in a way to provide insights and create products that improve quality of life and decision making.
In this project, my dashboard allows the user to sort animals instantly by breed, age, and rescue potential.
This gives the organization resources that can be used to save lives.
This type of project shows how computing can benefit real-world circumstances directly.
